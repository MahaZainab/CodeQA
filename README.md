# CodeQA

## Description:
It is a questioning answering dataset.  QA-based source code comprehension is the ability to read a code snippet and then answer questions about it, which requires understanding both source code and natural language. 

Given aa code snippet and a question, a textual answer need to be generated.

#### Question Anwer Pairs
Java Dataset: 119,7787

Python Dataset: 70,085

#### Methodology
This paper has done construction process(from comments) and conduct semantic analysis.

#### Note: 
QA-based source code comprehension has direct use in education to facilitate programming learning, where a system automatically answers questions about codes that someone has read.
