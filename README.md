# CodeQA

## Description:
It is a questioning answering dataset.  QA-based source code comprehension is the ability to read a code snippet and then answer questions about it, which requires understanding both source code and natural language. 

Given a code snippet and a question, a textual answer need to be generated.

#### Note:  
QA-based source code comprehension has direct use in education to facilitate programming learning, where a system automatically answers questions about codes that someone has read.  A more gen
eral use is to help improve software maintenance since it can advance the readability of code.

Moreover, it can provide diverse information that can be leveraged to help perform a wide range of software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, specification inference, testing and code synthesis.

## Dataset
Java Question Anwer Pairs : 119,7787

Python : 70,085
